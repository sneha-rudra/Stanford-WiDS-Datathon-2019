Deep Learning Architecture and Transfer Learning Parameters

1. Inception V3 is a neural network architecture trained on ImageNet (ILSVRC-2012-CLS)
2. Output for each image in the batch is a feature vector of size num_features = 2048
3. Size of the input image is fixed to height x width = 299 x 299 pixels
4. Input images are expected to have color values in the range [0,1], following the common image input conventions
5. Maximum number of images per class = 2**27 -1
6. Number of training steps = 4000
7. Learning rate = 0.01
8. Percentage of images to use as test set = 10 
9. Percentage of images to use as validation set = 10
10. Number of images to train on at a time = 100
11. Test batch size = Entire test set
12. Validation batch size = 100 images
13. Tensorflow hub module = https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/inception_v3/feature_vector/3
